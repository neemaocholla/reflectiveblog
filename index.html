            <h2>MY TITLE<br><br>Boundless: A Child of Two Worlds</h2>
            <p> This title encapsulates Trevor Noah's experience growing up in apartheid South Africa, emphasizing his biracial identity and the struggle to find belonging in a society that imposed strict racial categories. "Boundless" signifies his navigation across legal and cultural boundaries, as well as his journey through varied identities without fitting into a singular definition.</p>

            <h1>Self Reflection</h1>
            <div class="quote">
                <p>“Abel desired a traditional marriage with an old-fashioned wife… yet he never fell for submissive women… 'He only wants a woman who feels free because his dream is to confine her.’” </p>

                <p>This compelling contradiction highlights the complex tensions present in contemporary relationships. The essence of this quote exposes how patriarchal ideals endure across various cultures, not just in isolated communities. Men like Abel tend to idealize a “traditional” partner—a woman devoted to cooking, childcare, and cultural customs. However, when a woman asserts her independence through education or career aspirations, he perceives her freedom as a threat to the very values he admires.</p>

                <h2>Personal insight</h2>
                <p>In my own community, I've observed similar patterns. A cousin of mine recently ended her engagement after her fiancé insisted that she leave her job post-marriage. He portrayed his request as a means to maintain family cohesion, but his underlying anxiety stemmed from fearing a partner who might challenge his authority. In contrast, I know couples who communicate openly about their roles, sharing household tasks, finances, and decisions. Their mutual respect nurtures closeness instead of animosity.</p>
                <p>The global increase of digital feminism, along with the backlash against it, exemplifies this tension. Initiatives like HeForShe encourage men to promote equality, but some detractors label these participants as “emasculating” real men. The anxiety at play is evident: true equality often requires giving up exclusive advantages. Hence, Abel's wish for a “freed but caged” wife symbolizes a broader cultural struggle—where love becomes conditional on conformity.</p>
                <p>Authentic partnerships require embracing one's partner's freedom rather than fearing it. When both individuals are free to evolve, express disagreement, or challenge traditions, their relationship transforms into a nurturing space of empowerment, not a restrictive cage. Recognizing Abel's contradiction offers an opportunity to confront outdated norms and foster marriages rooted in respect and authentic equality.</p>
